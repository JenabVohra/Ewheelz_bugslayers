# Ewheelz_bugslayers

This was the project which we as team worked for whole semester during course.
It was a real testing project to be continued from basic test plan to developing test cases, from submitting agenda to keeping the logbook.
We used Scrum methodology for the overall project. It also followed SDLC process for updation in the application. We worked on unit testing by visiting the website and marking down its flaws manually and then develop test plan and gather requirements for developing test cases .
In addition to it, we had performed manual testing and measured its efficiency and errors
Then moving further with the automation testing using Selenium we obtained more details about the internal defects.
There was a load test perform using the glowroot and performance test by web stress tool. MySQL played a vital role in this project keeping the data we used for testing manually.
The overall project was run on agile processes and the sprints are generated every week can help to remain website working and the updation can take place if the flaw was corrected.
The management was done with maintaining IAD log , meeting agendas and minutes of meeting for every week.
The testing was done with by creating the documents like use cases , test scripts , test cases , tracebility matrix.
The reporting was done with the help of Test cycle report for phase 1 and phase 2.
